# Fishbot ðŸŽ£

## Feature Highlights

* Dynamic search and rendering for answer-supporting images
* A tiered LLM approach, based on grounding supports relevancy (all Gemini-based):
    1. Multi-turn custom grounded responses (most preferred)
    2. Single-turn custom grounded responses
    3. Single-turn Google Search grounded responses
    4. Ungrounded responses (least preferred)
* Custom grounding citations rendering
* EDW reporting on sessions, prompts, and responses
* Aggregate LLM request rate limiting (abuse prevention and cost control)

## Usage

| Environment Variable | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| DATASTORE_LOCATION | Location of the Vertex AI Agent Builder data store for custom grounding (e.g., "global") |
| DATASTORE_ID | ID of the Vertex AI Agent Builder data store for custom grounding (e.g., "fishbot-123") |
| DATASTORE_STATIC_HOST | Protocol and host for the file server containing the custom grounding sources (e.g., "https://example.com") |
| PEXELS_API_KEY | API key from pexels.com, for use in dynamic image rendering |
| REPORTING_DATASET | BigQuery dataset for storing usage reporting data (e.g., "fishbot_reporting") |
| REPORTING_TABLE | BigQuery table for storing usage reporting data, which will be created if it does not already exist (e.g., "responses") |
| REDIS_URL | IP or hostname for the Redis instance which is used for application-level LLM request rate limiting (e.g., "redis://localhost:6379")

## Infrastructure

The architecture includes:
1. A Cloud Run service with:
    1. "Internal + load balancer" ingress
    1. Custom 3600s HTTP request timeout (to reduce websocket-reconnection-related issues)
1. An External Global Application Load Balancer spanning both the chatbot and static files (custom grounding source)
    1. Serverless Network Endpoint backend for the Cloud Run service
    1. Public backend bucket for the static files
1. Vertex AI Agent Builder search app and data store, built over the static files bucket, for grounding
1. Cloud Armor backend policy, including:
    1. Select US sanctioned country blocking: Russia, Iran, Cuba, North Korea, Syria, and Belarus
    1. OWASP ModSecurity CRS 3.3 scanner protection
    1. Rate-based 30-minute ban for exceeding 60 requests/minute
        * Enforcement key is the concatenation of IP address and HTTP path
1. BigQuery dataset for prompt-response usage reporting
1. A small Memorystore for Redis instance to back aggregate LLM request rate-limiting
